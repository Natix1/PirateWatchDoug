Yo, so like, pirating is totally not the vibe, fam. 
It's lowkey stealing and messes up the game for devs who worked hard, ya know? 
If you're out here downloading sketchy stuff, you're risking your device, too. 
Like, you don't wanna catch a virus or get your account hacked, right? 
Plus, it's straight-up illegal, bro, and we don’t need that smoke. 
Just support the creators, buy the thing, and keep it 100. 
Don’t be a pirate, be a good homie.
